            <h2> Marks </h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Mark 1: Areas (the areas of each state on the US map)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mark 2: Trend Line at the top of the graphic
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2> Channels </h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                   Channel 1: Color Hue
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Color represents the attribute of what politcal party women would have voted for
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Color is an appropriate mapping in thi example because color allows the user to quickly identify which party would have won each state just using the colors. Colors are easy to spot and one of the most effective visualization tools.
                    </li>
                     
                </ul>

                <li>
                   Channel 2: Shape 
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Shape of graphic allows user to easily see that this is the US
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This is a good mapping because it shows the viewer each state outlined with a color on which party won in that states electorate
                    </li>
                     
                </ul>
            </ul>

            

            <h2> Colormap(s) </h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                   Colormap 1: Politcal Party (Red and Blue)
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This red and blue color map shows the attribute of politcal party. Blue for democratic and red for republican and which pary won each state.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This is a good mapping in this example because color is a very effective way of showing categorical data like political party. Since there are only two cateogries in this example (Democrat and Republican) it is easy for the viewer to quickly distinguish the two using color. 
                    </li>
                    
                </ul>

            <h2> Marks </h2>

            <ul>

                    Mark 1: Points 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2> Channels </h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                   Channel 1: Color Luminance and Hue
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Represents the scoring value of each at bat data point and how close each one is to the average.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Color mappying is a good mapping choice because it allows the user to quickly identify which data points are the outliers (i.e. home runs) in the visualization. 
                    </li>
                     
                </ul>

                <li>
                   Channel 2: Vertical Position 
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Represents the attribute of the launch angle of each batted ball
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Vertical positioning here is a good mapping choice because it allows the user to easily view how each data points compares to the other in terms of their outcome as the batting launch angle changes. 
                    </li>
                     
                </ul>

                <li>
                   Channel 3: Horizontal Position 
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Represents the attribute of the exxit velocity of each batted ball
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Horizontal positioning is a good mapping tool here because it allows the user to quickly identify how the outcome of each at bat changes as exit velocity changes. 
                    </li>
                     
                </ul>            </ul>

            

            <h2> Colormap(s) </h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                   Colormap 1: Average Scoring Value (Purple, Orange, and White)
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This color map details if batted balls are above or below the average scoring value. If above the data point will be orange and if below the data point will be purple and the saturation changes as the the data point is furhter away from the average. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This is a good color mapping becuause it uses two opposite colors to display the differences in the data which helps the viewer quickly identify which data points were the extreme and which area of data points had the most or the least home runs. 
                    </li>
                    
                </ul>

                    Mark 3: Color (color of outbreak point to show severity)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2> Channels </h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                   Channel 1: Color Hue
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Color represents the attribute of the severity of the outbreak for a given point
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Color is an appropriate mapping tool in this example because it uses two opposite colors (Red and Orange) to display severity. This makes it easy for the user to differentiate between data points. 
                    </li>
                     
                </ul>

                   Channel 2: Shape Area
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Different shape sizes show the attribute of how many people were infected in a given area
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This is an ok mapping technique becasue it allows the user to clearly see which areas had high amounts of exposure. However, it also makes the visualization a little confusing as it can be hard to decipher between different data points. 
                    </li>
                     
                </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>
                   Colormap 1: Outbreak Severity (death rate) (Red and Orange)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This red and blue color map shows the attribute of outbreak severity which has to do with the death rate. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This is an ok mapping tool becuase it does allow the user to differentiate between data points based on their color hue, but it is also confusing as the visualization does look a little overcrowded.
